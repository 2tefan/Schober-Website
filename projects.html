                Here some of my projects are highlighted. Unfortunately, this page is very prone to be outdated fairly
                quickly, because I am still a student and many projects are school-projects I extended and put a lot of
                time into it or are there to prove a point or
                to try out something new I learned.

                        Later on I also created an app, YAU, which can sync for lessons for school (from <a
                            href="https://webuntis.com/">Untis</a>) and add them
                        as a local calendar. This was quite difficult as the API for Untis (at least at this time) was
                        pretty bad (citation needed) and
                        to add a calendar to Android was not as easy as I thought (also there was not much
                        documentation on this topic). It was also quite interesting to
                        see how different manufacturers/Android flavours handle background tasks. See <a

                        This was the first thing that came to my mind, when I wanted to make my first Android App. In
                        the beginning it really just was a simple button which increased an Integer and this was
                        displayed on a TextView. Later on I learned during the development of this app how to save the
                        score, add preferences (settings), add animations, Google Play integration ... <br>
                        When I look back now, I find many things that I would do now differently, and some things even
                        annoy me a bit. But I really like looking back to this app, because in some sense, it is
                        where it all started.

                        After Schober Clicker, I wanted to do another app. This is it. It is pretty simple, and I didn't
                        "overload" it with (useless?) features as in Schober Clicker. I am pretty happy with it, but I
                        find
                        it quite interesting, that back when I developed it, I didn't know what a <a
                            href="https://www.javatpoint.com/java-constructor">constructor</a> was. So I wrote my own
                        initialization functions üòÖ. <br>
                        But as said before, I find it quite fascinating how my coding style since then changed.
